Dear Colleagues,

While we are not directly working on [Segment Anything Models (SAM)](https://segment-anything.com), our team at Johns Hopkins University has been collecting and annotating large-scale datasets for Medical SAM. We believe [our dataset](https://www.zongweiz.com/dataset) would be of great interest if you plan to adapt [SAM2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/) to medical images.

We are progressively releasing **9,262 3D CT volumes** and **231,550 3D anatomical masks** to the public. In support of Medical SAM, we are happy to proactively share these data with you for beta test.

*Simply reply to this email <zzhou82@jh.edu> if you would like access to our dataset.*
*We would greatly appreciate it if you could also forward this message to colleagues who might be interested in SAM for segmenting medical images.*

Below is a list of papers relevant to Medical SAM(2). Feel free to create pull requests to make this list more comprehensive.
